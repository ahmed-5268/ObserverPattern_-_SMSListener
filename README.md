 >Observer Pattern & Event Management System
 Welcome to My Lab 3 Project!
>This repository contains implementations of:
 *Observer Pattern â€“ Demonstrating how observers react to state changes dynamically.
 *Event Management System â€“ Handling SMS notifications using the Observer Pattern.

Table of Contents:


*Observer Pattern:
ðŸ“Œ First, watch the ObserverPattern video before running the code.

The Observer Pattern is used to notify multiple objects (observers) when the state of a subject changes.

We implement an Observer interface and different observer types (Binary, Octal, Hexa).

Key Features:
attach() to subscribe an observer.
detach() to remove an observer.
notifyAllObservers() to update all active observers.

*Event Management System (SMS Support)
ðŸ“Œ After the Observer Pattern video, watch the EventManagement video for SMS notifications.

This system extends the Observer Pattern for real-world event handling (e.g., file uploads).

EventManager manages multiple event listeners.

SMSSupportListener sends an SMS when a file upload event occurs.

The listener checks if the message exceeds 160 characters before sending.



*About Videos:
i have made two videos for both the questions. first watch observer pattern video. thank You!
